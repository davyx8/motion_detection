1. Write three classes: Streamer- receives a file path or rtsp, and reads frames using opencv, , with option for resize. Detector, receives frames and runs basic motion detection with this code:		frameDelta = cv2.absdiff(firstFrame, gray)	thresh = cv2.threshold(frameDelta, 25, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)[1]	# dilate the thresholded image to fill in holes, then find contours	# on thresholded image	thresh = cv2.dilate(thresh, None, iterations=2)	cnts = cv2.findContours(thresh.copy(), cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL,		cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)	cnts = imutils.grab_contours(cnts)	# loop over the contours	for c in cnts:		# if the contour is too small, ignore it		if cv2.contourArea(c) < args[min_area]:			continue		# compute the bounding box for the contour, draw it on the frame,		# and update the text		(x, y, w, h) = cv2.boundingRect(c)		cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)		And the third class : Player that plays the stream after the detection with bbox on the detections. write also a main that will fire up each of the classes in its own process, and use a queue for communication between them 

2. Now add to the player on the upper left corner time with hours minutes seconds and ms, and add an option to blur the detections in the player. also the played movie should play in the same speed as the original

3. this is my code: ... please add to it , that when the video stream is over, all processes shut down, also fix the time stamp to be white bigger, and to be seconds from start of stream .

4. get me a readme with nice markup, also add limitations section: no variable fps, and anything else that comes into your mind. and requirements.txt . 

5. markup only!!!!!!!!!

6. video is abit jumpy, fix it.

7. adding clear_queue didnt work, what else can be done?

8. give me requirements.txt file
